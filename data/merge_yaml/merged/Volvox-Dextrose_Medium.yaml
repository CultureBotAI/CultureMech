preparation_steps:
- step_number: 1
  instruction: Important Notes To Consider:The quality of water, including natural
    seawater, is important.
- step_number: 2
  instruction: The term 'dH2O' generally refers to distilled, deionized, distilled/deionized
    water, Milli-Q water (Millipore Corp.), etc.
- step_number: 3
  instruction: Natural seawater and natural freshwater should be obtained from a non-polluted
    source.When dissolving chemicals, wait for the first component to dissolve before
    adding the second.
- step_number: 4
  instruction: Stirring, and sometimes the addition of heat, is often required to
    dissolve the chemicals efficiently.
- step_number: 5
  instruction: Preparation of stock solutions for frequently made algal culture media
    make preparing media convenient but also necessary to avoid errors from weighing
    very tiny amounts.Attention should be given to the pH of the final medium.
- step_number: 6
  instruction: In most cases, if pH adjustment is required, this occurs before sterilization.
- step_number: 7
  instruction: Please note that autoclaving removes carbon dioxide from media lacking
    carbonate stabilizing buffers.
- step_number: 8
  instruction: This would make the medium very alkaline soon after removal from the
    autoclave.
- step_number: 9
  instruction: In these cases, you should wait approximately 24 hours for gaseous
    equilibrium before inoculating the medium.
light_intensity: Varies by species; typically 50-100 µmol photons m⁻² s⁻¹
light_cycle: Varies by species; commonly 12:12 or 16:8 light:dark
temperature_range: 15-30°C depending on species
applications:
- Algae cultivation
- Phytoplankton culture
- Microalgae research
