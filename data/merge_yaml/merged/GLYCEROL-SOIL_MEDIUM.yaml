  action: AUTOCLAVE
  description: Adjust pH to 7.0. Soil extract is prepared by sieving air dried garden
    soil through a coarse sieve and autoclaving 400 g with 960 ml of distilled water
    at 121°C for one hour. After the mixture is cool and settled, the supernatant
    is carefully decanted, filtered through paper, autoclaved in 200 ml quantities,
    and stored at room temperature until cleared by sedimentation.
