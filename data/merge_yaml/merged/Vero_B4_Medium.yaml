preparation_steps:
- step_number: 1
  action: MIX
  description: Cultivation of Vero B4 (ACC 33) cells
- step_number: 2
  action: FILTER_STERILIZE
  description: Filter-sterilize (0.2 µm) and keep no longer than 4 weeks. Store at
    room temperature to facilitate detection of contamination.
- step_number: 3
  action: HEAT
  description: Prepare a 25 cm2 flask and seed cells according to standard protocols
    (see DSMZ catalogue for ACC 33). Incubate at 37°C plus 5% CO2. When a confluent
    layer has formed, infection can be carried out.
- step_number: 4
  action: HEAT
  description: Infect cells with 1 ml of Rickettsia stock solution (thawed quickly
    to 37°C).
- step_number: 5
  action: HEAT
  description: Centrifuge for 1 h onto the cell layer at 1600 rpm at 20°C.
- step_number: 6
  action: HEAT
  description: Incubate at 28°C. Up to 90% of Vero cells should be infected after
    15 days. Specific PCRs can be performed to verify the presence of rickettsiae.
    Ultimately, in situ-hybridization can be used to visualize them.
