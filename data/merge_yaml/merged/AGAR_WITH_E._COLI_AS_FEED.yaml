  description: Adjust pH to 7.2, autoclave and pour plates. Grow Escherichia coli
    (e.g. DSM 498) in liquid culture, collect cells by centrifugation and resuspend
    them in enough water to receive a thick but ready-to-pipet suspension. Autoclave.
    Place three separate drops on one CaCl2-agar plate and streak every drop once
    to receive E. coli lines, about 3 cm long, across the E. coli drops. Inoculate
    E. coli lines/drops with myxobacteria.
