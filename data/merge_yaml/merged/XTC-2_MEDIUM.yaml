preparation_steps:
- step_number: 1
  action: MIX
  description: Cultivation of XTC-2 (from Xenopus laevis) cells
- step_number: 2
  action: FILTER_STERILIZE
  description: Filter-sterilize (0.2 µm) and keep no longer than 4 weeks. Store at
    room temperature to facilitate detection of contamination.
- step_number: 3
  action: HEAT
  description: Prepare a 25 cm<sup>2</sup> flask and seed cells according to standard
    protocols. Incubate at 28 - 32°C in hermetic flasks. Cells are easily detached
    mechanically, no enzyme is necessary. Medium should be changed once a week. When
    a confluent layer has formed, infection can be carried out.
- step_number: 4
  action: HEAT
  description: 'Infect cells with 1 ml of Diplorickettsia stock solution (thawed quickly
    to 37°C). Incubate for 1 h at room temperature. Cultivation temperature: 28°C.'
- step_number: 5
  action: MIX
  description: Up to 100% of the cells should be infected after several days. The
    infection level is evaluated after 3 days by Cytospin and Gimenez staining. Cytopathic
    effects may be visible after 3-5 days. Specific PCRs can be performed to verify
    the presence of diplorickettsiae.
