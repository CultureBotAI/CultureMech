  action: MIX
  description: 'Maintenance conditions of SF-9 cells (see also DSMZ catalogue for
    ACC 125):'
- step_number: 4
  action: HEAT
  description: SF-9 cells are cultivated at 25 - 29°C without the addition of CO2
    in flasks (25 cm2) with tightly closed lids. When a confluent layer has formed,
    infection can be carried out.

- step_number: 6
  action: HEAT
  description: "Exchange medium and add 500 – 1000 µl of EB stock solution (thawed\
    \ quickly to 37°C).\r\nCentrifuge for 1 h onto the cell layer at 1600 rpm at 20°C."

  description: 'Maintenance/Passage of infected insect cell cultures:'
- step_number: 8
  action: HEAT
  description: "Infected cultures can be maintained e.g. in 25 cm2 flasks (e.g. Nunc\
    \ flasks, VWR, 734-\r\n2081) at 27°C in an incubator (no special requirements\
    \ concerning CO2 or light).\r\nIf the percentage of infected cells is still low\
    \ (which might occur initially after inoculation\r\nof cultures with bacteria\
    \ from a frozen stock) infected cultures may be maintained by\r\nweekly passage\
    \ (1:5). Infection of yet uninfected cells by added bacteria or bacteria\r\nreleased\
    \ from neighboring infected cells is facilitated by centrifugation (130 x g, 15\
    \ min)\r\nof the culture flask.\r\nIn well-infected cultures host cell lysis will\
    \ be visible (the bacteria cause host cell lysis\r\nwithin approximately 5-7 days\
    \ after invasion of host cells). To maintain such cultures,\r\nbacteria have to\
    \ be transferred by adding culture supernatant (approximately 0.5-1 ml)\r\nto\
    \ fresh culture flasks containing uninfected insect cells (approximately semi-confluent\r\
    \nculture) each 7-10 days."
