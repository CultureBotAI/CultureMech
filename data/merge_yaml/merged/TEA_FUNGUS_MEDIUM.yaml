  description: Add tea and sucrose to a 1 l flask, pour on freshly boiled tap water
    and allow to stand for 15 minutes. Filter and cool to room temperature. When starting
    with a small amount of tea fungus use a 50 ml beaker and 10 ml of the sweetened
    tea (freed of leaves) which has been acidified by addition of 0.05 ml of boiled
    vinegar (5%). Place a small disc of a cork stopper on the surface of the tea and
    place the inoculum onto it. Cover the beaker with aluminium foil and incubate.
    (Steam the cork disc for 15 min on two successive days).
