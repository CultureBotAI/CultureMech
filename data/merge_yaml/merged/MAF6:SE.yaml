preparation_steps:
- step_number: 1
  action: AUTOCLAVE
  description: "Make up to 1 litre with distilled water. pH is adjusted to 6.6.  Autoclave\
    \ at 15 psi for \r\n15 minutes."
- step_number: 2
  action: MIX
  description: "Add to 1000 ml of distilled water 0.75 g Na2EDTA and the minerals\
    \ in exactly the \r\nfollowing sequence:"
- step_number: 3
  action: FILTER_STERILIZE
  description: Filter sterile
- step_number: 4
  action: FILTER_STERILIZE
  description: Take 1 ml of this solution and add 99 ml Deionised water. Filter sterile.
- step_number: 5
  action: MIX
  description: "Site selection for a good soil is very important and for most purposes\
    \ a soil from \r\nundisturbed deciduous woodland is best.  Sites to avoid are\
    \ those showing obvious \r\nsigns of man's activity and particular care should\
    \ be taken to avoid areas where \r\nfertilizers, crop sprays or other toxic chemicals\
    \ may have been used."
- step_number: 6
  action: STORE
  description: "A rich loam with good crumb structure should be sought.  Stones, roots\
    \ and larger \r\ninvertebrates should be removed during an initial sieving through\
    \ a 1 cm mesh.  The sieved soil should be spread to air dry and hand picked for\
    \ smaller \r\ninvertebrates and roots.  It should be turned periodically and picked\
    \ over again.  When dry it may be sieved through a finer mesh (2­4 mm) or stored\
    \ as it is prior to\r\nuse."
- step_number: 7
  action: AUTOCLAVE
  description: "Soil is prepared as above.  105 g of air­dried sieved soil and 660\
    \ ml of deionized \r\nwater are placed in a 1 litre bottle and autoclaved once\
    \ at 15 psi for 15 minutes, \r\nthen again after 24 hours.  The contents of the\
    \ bottle are left to settle (usually for \r\nat least a week) and then the supernatant\
    \ is decanted and filtered.  The final pH\r\nshould be 7.0 - 8.0."
