  action: AUTOCLAVE
  description: Soil extract is prepared by sieving air dried garden soil through a
    coarse sieve and autoclaving 400 g with 960 ml of distilled water at 121°C for
    one hour. After the mixture is cool and settled, the supernatant is carefully
    decanted, filtered through paper, autoclaved in 200 ml quantities, and stored
    at room temperature until cleared by sedimentation.
