  action: AUTOCLAVE
  description: Dissolve dehydrated RCM medium (available from BD BBL, OXOID, or MERCK)
    and Casamino acids (15.0 g/l) in distilled water and add 0.5 ml/l Na-resazurin
    solution (0.1% w/v). Bring to a boil and cool to room temperature while sparging
    with 100% N2 gas. Dispense the medium into anoxic Hungate-type tubes or serum
    vials and autoclave for 15 min at 121°C. Adjust the pH of the complete medium
    to 6.8.
