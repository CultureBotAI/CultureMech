  description: "Put a layer about 1 cm deep of air-dried, sieved good calcareous garden\
    \ loam into a\r\ntest tube or jar. (The use of mud from rivers or ponds is rarely\
    \ satisfactory.)\r\nCarefully add deionised water to a depth of 7 to 10 cm, plug\
    \ or cover, and steam\r\nfor one hour or autoclave for 15 minutes at 15 psi (longer\
    \ for larger vessels) on\r\neach of 2 consecutive days; further sterilisation\
    \ is not needed. Allow to stand for a\r\nfurther day before inoculating, when\
    \ the pH should be between 7.0 - 8.0."
- step_number: 2
  action: MIX
  description: "S/W is  prepared  as  above,  but approximately  0.01  g  ammonium\
    \  magnesium \r\nphosphate is placed into the base of the test tube before adding\
    \ the soil and water."
