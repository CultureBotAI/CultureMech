preparation_steps:
- step_number: 1
  action: MIX
  description: Dehydrated media preparations are available from media distributors.
- step_number: 2
  action: MIX
  description: We use OXOID Legionella CYE-Agar base with Legionella BCYE supplement.
- step_number: 3
  action: MIX
  description: For solubilization of the lyophilized pellet use standard liquid media.
    Although Legionellae do not grow in those media they are suitable for resuspension
    and transfer onto agar plates.
- step_number: 4
  action: MIX
  description: 'Note: Alternatively use CYE-ACES AGAR'
- step_number: 5
  action: POUR_PLATES
  description: Add Cysteine-HCl, then ferric pyrophosphate solution to solution A.
    Adjust the complete medium to pH 6.9 ± 0.5 at 50°C with sterile 1.0 N KOH or HCl.
    The pH of the medium is critical. Finally, add solution B. Swirl medium in flask
    during dispensing to petri dishes or tubes in order to keep charcoal suspended.
- step_number: 6
  action: AUTOCLAVE
  description: Dissolve ACES and bring to pH 6.9 by slowly adding 1 N KOH. Add the
    other components and dissolve by boiling. Autoclave at 121°C for 15 minutes. Cool
    to 50 - 55°C.
- step_number: 7
  action: AUTOCLAVE
  description: Autoclave at 121°C and cool to 50 - 55°C.
- step_number: 8
  action: FILTER_STERILIZE
  description: Prepare a fresh solution and filter-sterilize it.
- step_number: 9
  action: FILTER_STERILIZE
  description: Prepare a fresh solution by heating to 50 - 55°C in a water-bath. Filter-sterilize
    solution separately.
- step_number: 10
  action: MIX
  description: 'Please note: Soluble ferric pyrophosphate must be kept dry and in
    the dark. Do not use if chemical looses its green colour and becomes brown or
    yellow.'
