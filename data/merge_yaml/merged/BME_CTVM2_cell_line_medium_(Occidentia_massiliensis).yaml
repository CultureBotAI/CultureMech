- step_number: 4
  action: MIX
  description: All tick cell lines are incubated in an atmosphere of ordinary air,
    in sealed flasks or flat-sided tubes (Nunc, product no. 156758) in dry incubators.
    Medium changing is done once a week by removal and replacement of between 50%
    and 80% of the medium volume. Tick cells can survive for relatively long periods
    without attention - up to 3 weeks without a medium change -, and for several months
    without subculture if necessary. They prefer not to be subcultured too often!
- step_number: 5
  action: MIX
  description: Subculture is done when required, but not usually more often than fortnightly,
    as follows (method for 25cm2 flasks). On a medium change day, the spent medium
    from the culture to be passaged is put into the new flask(s) to condition them
    overnight. Next day the spent medium is discarded from the new flask(s), an appropriate
    volume of fresh medium (5ml for one new flask, 10ml for 2 new flasks etc) is added
    to the parent flask, any adherent cells are pipetted off, and the appropriate
    volume of cell suspension is transferred to the new flask(s), leaving 5ml in the
    parent flask. The parent flask is always retained, and can be used for subculture
    repeatedly over several months or years. Trypsin or EDTA are never used, as the
    tick cells do not like them.

  action: HEAT
  description: '<b>Infection with Occidentia massiliensis: </b> From one 25 cm2 flask
    of well-grown cells the medium is reduced to 5 ml, 3 ml of fresh medium are added
    and 1 ml of the Occidentia strain (quickly thawed from -80°C ) is used to infect
    the cells. Incubate at 28°C with closed lid (without CO2) and look for bacteria
    and destroyed cells after 7-10 days (using Gimenez staining after one week). To
    obtain more than 90% infected cells takes about 14 - 21 days .'
