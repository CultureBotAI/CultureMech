preparation_steps:
- step_number: 1
  action: AUTOCLAVE
  description: "This medium is made up in 2 parts which are autoclaved separately\
    \ at 15 psi and \r\nmixed aseptically (1:1), when cool. This avoids precipitation."
- step_number: 2
  action: MIX
  description: "Alternatively,  use  17.5g  of  “Ultramarine  Synthetica” sea  salts\
    \ in\r\n500ml of distilled water."
- step_number: 3
  action: AUTOCLAVE
  description: Distilled water to 500 ml.  Autoclave
- step_number: 4
  action: MIX
  description: "Site selection for a good soil is very important and for most purposes\
    \ a soil from undisturbed\r\ndeciduous woodland is best. Sites to avoid are those\
    \ showing obvious signs of man's activity\r\nand particular care should be taken\
    \ to avoid areas where fertilizers, crop sprays or other toxic\r\nchemicals may\
    \ have been used."
- step_number: 5
  action: HEAT
  description: "A rich loam with good crumb structure should be sought. Stones, roots\
    \ and larger\r\ninvertebrates should be removed during an initial sieving through\
    \ a 1 cm mesh. The sieved\r\nsoil should be spread to air dry and handpicked for\
    \ smaller invertebrates and roots. It should\r\nbe turned periodically and picked\
    \ over again. When dry sieve through a finer mesh (2-4 mm)\r\nand store in an\
    \ airtight container away from light and heat."
- step_number: 6
  action: AUTOCLAVE
  description: "Soil is  prepared  as  above.  Air­-dried  soil and  twice  its  volume\
    \  of  supernatant\r\ndistilled water are autoclaved together at 15 psi for 2\
    \ hours and left to cool.  The \r\nsupernatant is then decanted and filtered through\
    \ Whatman No 1 filter paper, then\r\ndistributed to containers in volumes suitable\
    \ for making up batches of media. The \r\naliquots and their containers are autoclaved\
    \ for an appropriate length of time (e.g.\r\n1 litre or less for 15 minutes) and\
    \ are then kept in a cool place (e.g. a refrigerator) \r\nuntil required."
