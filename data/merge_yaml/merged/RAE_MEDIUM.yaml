preparation_steps:
- step_number: 1
  action: MIX
  description: Final pH ca. 3.8 (pH is not adjusted)
- step_number: 2
  action: AUTOCLAVE
  description: Both liquid and solid media are prepared by autoclaving the medium
    without the addition of glacial acetic acid and absolute ethanol. Glacial acetic
    acid and absolute ethanol are sterilised either by filtration (use Teflon filters)
    or they may be autoclaved in completely closed screw cap glass bottles sealed
    with a Teflon coated septum. The preparation of solid media employs a double layer
    system similar to that described for Acetobacter europaeus medium (see medium
    631). Substitute the components listed above and prepare a lower, 0.5% agar layer,
    which is then overlaid with a 1.0% agar layer as described in medium 631. Incubate
    in closed containers to keep the humidity high (> 90%).
- step_number: 3
  action: FILTER_STERILIZE
  description: The ethanol and acetic acid are sterilized separately by filtration
    (use filter resistant to these solvents), and added aseptically to the sterile
    medium. Acetobacter europaeus will not grow on plates containing 1-2% agar, and
    a double layer system has to be used. A layer of growth medium containing 0.5%
    agar (about 35 ml) is poured into a plate and allowed to solidify. A thin layer
    (5-10 ml) of the growth medium containing 1% agar is then poured on top. Carefully
    streak the plates, which are best incubated in closed containers (e.g. plastic
    boxes) at 30°C.
