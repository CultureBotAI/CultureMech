preparation_steps:
- step_number: 1
  instruction: Important Notes To Consider:The quality of water, including natural
    seawater, is important.
- step_number: 2
  instruction: The term 'dH2O' generally refers to distilled, deionized, distilled/deionized
    water, Milli-Q water (Millipore Corp.), etc.
- step_number: 3
  instruction: Natural seawater and natural freshwater should be obtained from a non-polluted
    source.When dissolving chemicals, wait for the first component to dissolve before
    adding the second.
- step_number: 4
  instruction: Stirring, and sometimes the addition of heat, is often required to
    dissolve the chemicals efficiently.
- step_number: 5
  instruction: Preparation of stock solutions for frequently made algal culture media
    make preparing media convenient but also necessary to avoid errors from weighing
    very tiny amounts.Attention should be given to the pH of the final medium.
- step_number: 6
  instruction: In most cases, if pH adjustment is required, this occurs before sterilization.
- step_number: 7
  instruction: Please note that autoclaving removes carbon dioxide from media lacking
    carbonate stabilizing buffers.
- step_number: 8
  instruction: This would make the medium very alkaline soon after removal from the
    autoclave.
- step_number: 9
  instruction: In these cases, you should wait approximately 24 hours for gaseous
    equilibrium before inoculating the medium.
notes: 'Soil Extract + Sodium Metasilicate MediumModification of Soil Extract Medium
  for diatoms.DirectionsFor 1 L TotalPrepare 1 L of Bristol Medium and thoroughly
  mix.Discard 40 mL of the Bristol Medium.Add 40 mL of previously prepared GR+ Medium
  [Note: The GR+ should be filtered to remove soil particles].For 1.5% agar medium
  add 15 g of agar into the flask; do not mix.Cover and autoclave medium.When cooled,
  add filter sterilized sodium metasilicate.For agar medium, add sodium metasilicate,
  mix, and dispense before agar solidifies.Store at refrigerator temperature.#ComponentAmountStock
