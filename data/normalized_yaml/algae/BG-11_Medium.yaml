preparation_steps:
- step_number: 1
  instruction: Important Notes To Consider:The quality of water, including natural
    seawater, is important.
- step_number: 2
  instruction: The term 'dH2O' generally refers to distilled, deionized, distilled/deionized
    water, Milli-Q water (Millipore Corp.), etc.
- step_number: 3
  instruction: Natural seawater and natural freshwater should be obtained from a non-polluted
    source.When dissolving chemicals, wait for the first component to dissolve before
    adding the second.
- step_number: 4
  instruction: Stirring, and sometimes the addition of heat, is often required to
    dissolve the chemicals efficiently.
- step_number: 5
  instruction: Preparation of stock solutions for frequently made algal culture media
    make preparing media convenient but also necessary to avoid errors from weighing
    very tiny amounts.Attention should be given to the pH of the final medium.
- step_number: 6
  instruction: In most cases, if pH adjustment is required, this occurs before sterilization.
- step_number: 7
  instruction: Please note that autoclaving removes carbon dioxide from media lacking
    carbonate stabilizing buffers.
- step_number: 8
  instruction: This would make the medium very alkaline soon after removal from the
    autoclave.
- step_number: 9
  instruction: In these cases, you should wait approximately 24 hours for gaseous
    equilibrium before inoculating the medium.
notes: BG-11 MediumImproved recipe as of March 2009DirectionsFor 1 L TotalLiquid media:To
  approximately 900 mL of dH2O add the first 9 components in the order specified while
  stirring continuously.Bring total volume to 1 L with dH2O.Cover and autoclave medium.Allow
  to cool then store at refrigerator temperature.Agar media:To approximately 400 mL
  of dH2O add the first 9 components in the order specified while stirring continuously.Bring
  total volume to 500 mL with dH2O.In a separate container add 15 g of agar to 500
  mL of dH2O.Cover and autoclave both solutions.In a water bath allow both solutions
  to cool to 45-50°C.Add sterile Sodium Thiosulfate (Component 10) to agar solution
  and mix well.Combine both agar and liquid solutions, mix well. Note the agar can
  solidify quickly.Allow to cool then store at refrigerator temperature.#ComponentAmountStock
