- step_number: 1
  action: AUTOCLAVE
  description: Sterilize vitamin B12 separately by filtration. Prepare and store yeast
    cells as autoclaved stock suspension (5 g baker's yeast/100 ml distilled water,
    adjust pH to 6.5 and autoclave). Adjust pH of medium to 7.2 with KOH before, and
    after autoclaving and cooling to 50°C (use pH-indicator paper).
- step_number: 2
  action: DISSOLVE
  description: 'Cultures of myxobacteria delivered freeze-dried: Please see our video
    tutorial and follow the special instructions: ''Reactivation of Myxobacteria''
    given with the strain entry of our catalogue. For suspending the freeze-dried
    cells from ampoules, add about 0.5 - 1.0 ml medium MD1 (per liter: casiton 3.0
    g; CaCl2 x 2 H2O, 0.7 g; Mg2SO4 x 7 H2O, 2.0 g) to the vial with freeze dried
    material.'
- step_number: 3
  action: HEAT
  description: 'Cultures of myxobacteria delivered as active cultures (growing on
    agar plates): Always use the rim of the swarm as inoculum for fresh media. If
    the swarms are creamy, transfer high amounts of cell mass to several spots on
    fresh VY/2 agar medium. If the swarm adheres to the agar or grows within the agar,
    cut small agar cubes from the rim of the swarm and place onto a fresh agar plate
    using an appropriate tool such as a lancet. Make sure that the pieces of swarm
    colonies grown on the agar are transferred to the agar plate. Attempt to place
    the inoculum in such a way that the swarms are in contact with the fresh agar
    plate.'
- step_number: 4
  action: MIX
  description: Incubate for up to 3 weeks (in particular Sorangium and Nannocystis
    strains) at the temperature given for the strain, taking measures against desiccation.
    If there is no growth after ten days, carefully split up the agar-culture-cubes
    and squeeze the material to the agar plate and reincubate.
