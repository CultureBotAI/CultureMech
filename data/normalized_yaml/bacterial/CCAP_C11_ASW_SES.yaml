preparation_steps:
- step_number: 1
  action: MIX
  description: 3:1 mixture
- step_number: 2
  action: MIX
  description: "See separate recipes ASW and SES.  This medium is made up in 2 parts\
    \ which are \r\nmixed before autoclaving."
- step_number: 3
  action: AUTOCLAVE
  description: "Make up to 1 litre with filtered natural sea water.  Adjust the pH\
    \ to 7.6 – 7.8 with\r\n1N NaOH or 1N HCl. Autoclave at 15 psi."
- step_number: 4
  action: ADJUST_PH
  description: "Alternatively use \"Ultramarine Synthetica\" sea salts 33.6 g and\
    \ make up to 1 \r\nlitre  with distilled water.  Adjust pH as above"
- step_number: 5
  action: AUTOCLAVE
  description: Make up to 1 litre with deionized water and autoclave at 15 psi for
    15 minutes.
- step_number: 6
  action: MIX
  description: "Site selection for a good soil is very important and for most purposes\
    \ a soil from undisturbed\r\ndeciduous woodland is best. Sites to avoid are those\
    \ showing obvious signs of man's activity\r\nand particular care should be taken\
    \ to avoid areas where fertilizers, crop sprays or other toxic\r\nchemicals may\
    \ have been used."
- step_number: 7
  action: HEAT
  description: "A rich loam with good crumb structure should be sought. Stones, roots\
    \ and larger\r\ninvertebrates should be removed during an initial sieving through\
    \ a 1 cm mesh. The sieved\r\nsoil should be spread to air dry and handpicked for\
    \ smaller invertebrates and roots. It should\r\nbe turned periodically and picked\
    \ over again. When dry sieve through a finer mesh (2-4 mm)\r\nand store in an\
    \ airtight container away from light and heat."
- step_number: 8
  action: AUTOCLAVE
  description: "Soil is  prepared  as  above.  Air­-dried  soil and  twice  its  volume\
    \  of  supernatant\r\ndistilled water are autoclaved together at 15 psi for 2\
    \ hours and left to cool.  The \r\nsupernatant is then decanted and filtered through\
    \ Whatman No 1 filter paper, then\r\ndistributed to containers in volumes suitable\
    \ for making up batches of media. The \r\naliquots and their containers are autoclaved\
    \ for an appropriate length of time (e.g.\r\n1 litre or less for 15 minutes) and\
    \ are then kept in a cool place (e.g. a refrigerator) \r\nuntil required."
