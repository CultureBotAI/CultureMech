preparation_steps:
- step_number: 1
  action: FILTER_STERILIZE
  description: Mix components, adjust pH to 6.0-6.2. After autoclaving and then cooling
    to 50-55C, aseptically add the following solutions (filter-sterilized).
- step_number: 2
  action: MIX
  description: <i>1% Phenol red solution:</i>
- step_number: 3
  action: FILTER_STERILIZE
  description: Dissolve 1.0 g phenol red first in 10-20 ml of 0.1 N NaOH. Then adjust
    volume to 100 ml. After filter-sterilizing, store at 4C.
- step_number: 4
  action: MIX
  description: <i>1% Urea - 4% yeast extract solution:</i>
- step_number: 5
  action: FILTER_STERILIZE
  description: Mix components, sterilize by filtration through a 0.22 ï¿½m filter
    and store at 4C.
- step_number: 6
  action: POUR_PLATES
  description: Dispense the medium into sterilized plastic tubes (e.g., 5 ml medium
    in 15 ml of plastic tubes) and add 100-200 ï¿½l of culture solution. Incubate
    the cultures at 37C for 1-3 days. When the color of the medium turns from yellow
    to orange or red, subculture into the new medium. After color change, the strain
    can be stored at 4C for 1-2 weeks.
