preparation_steps:
- step_number: 1
  action: AUTOCLAVE
  description: 'The medium was autoclaved and removed from the autoclave at 85°C.
    Oxygen dissolution was prevented by exchanging the gas-phase with N2. The medium
    was complemented by addition of the following stock solutions:'
- step_number: 2
  action: MIX
  description: After adding bicarbonate the gas was changed from N2 to N2/CO2 (90/10
    %, v/v) and the pH was adjusted to 7.2 - 7.4 with sterile 2 M HCL.
- step_number: 3
  action: HEAT
  description: The trace element solution was prepared by dissolving the salts in
    800 mL warm H2Obidest
- step_number: 4
  action: AUTOCLAVE
  description: NaOH was used to adjust the pH to 6.5. The solution was added up to
    1000 mL with H2Obidest and autoclaved.
- step_number: 5
  action: FILTER_STERILIZE
  description: The solution was filter-sterilized and stored at 4°C in the dark.
- step_number: 6
  action: FILTER_STERILIZE
  description: The solution was filter-sterilized and stored at 4°C in the dark.
- step_number: 7
  action: AUTOCLAVE
  description: The solution was dispensed in the required portions (40 mL per 1 L
    medium). The head space of the bottles was flushed with CO2. Saturation of CO2
    in the solution was achieved by repeated flushing and shaking of the bottles.
    Finally, the bottles were sealed with rubber stoppers and aluminum crimps and
    autoclaved.
- step_number: 8
  action: AUTOCLAVE
  description: In an ice bath ascorbic acid was dissolved in 80 mL anoxic H2Obidest
    (autoclaved, cooled under N2 atmosphere) while flushing with N2. The pH was adjusted
    to 7.0 with NaOH and the solution added up to 100 ml with anoxic H2Obidest. After
    filter-sterilization the solution was stored under N2 atmosphere in a special
    flask (which can be flushed with gas) at 4°C in the dark.
- step_number: 9
  action: FILTER_STERILIZE
  description: The solution was filter-sterilized and stored at room temperature.
