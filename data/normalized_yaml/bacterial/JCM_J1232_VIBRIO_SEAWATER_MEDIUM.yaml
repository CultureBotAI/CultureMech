ingredients:
- preferred_term: Sea water
  concentration:
    value: '100'
    unit: G_PER_L
preparation_steps:
- step_number: 1
  action: MIX
  description: Aseptically combine. Cultivate with shaking (150 - 200 rpm) for 16
    - 24 hr. Separate from the prey bacteria physically (e.g., centrifugation), if
    necessary.
- step_number: 2
  action: DISSOLVE
  description: Cultivate <I>Vibrio alginolyticus</I> JCM 32963 (or any <I>Vibrio</I>
    strain that can be served as prey bacteria) in 100 ml Marine Broth 2216 (Medium
    No. 41) with shaking at 150 - 200 rpm for 24 hr. Aseptically centrifuge the culture
    at 8,000 x g for 5 min. Remove the supernatant and suspend precipitated cells
    in 10 ml sterile seawater (pH 7.6 - 8.0). The cell suspension can be preserved
    at 4C for a couple of days.
- step_number: 3
  action: AUTOCLAVE
  description: 'Comment: For cultivation on solid media, the double-layer agar technique
    can be used. Typically, pour autoclaved seawater containing 1.5% agar (cool to
    50 - 60C) to 9 cm petri dishes (15.0 ml per dish) and allow to solidify (bottom
    agar medium). Autoclave seawater containing 0.7% agar, cool to 60 - 65C and distribute
    10 ml each of the molten agar solution into tubes kept at 50C (top agar medium).
    Then, add 1 ml of inoculum (bacterial cell suspension) and 1 ml of the concentrated
    <I>Vibrio</I> suspension to the top agar medium. Quickly mix the top agar medium
    and pour onto the bottom agar medium.'
