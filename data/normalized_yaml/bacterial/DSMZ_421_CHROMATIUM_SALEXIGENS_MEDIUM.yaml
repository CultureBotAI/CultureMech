preparation_steps:
- step_number: 1
  action: MIX
  description: Supplement medium 28 with NaCl (10%), MgCl2 x 6 H2O (0.3%) Na-acetate
    (0.05%) and sodium thiosulfate (0.05%). Incubate at 500 to 1000 Lux light intensity.
- step_number: 2
  action: FILTER_STERILIZE
  description: Adjust the pH with filter-sterilised 1M Na2CO3 to 7.1-7.3.
- step_number: 3
  action: ALIQUOT
  description: If needed, aliquot into sterile, N<sub>2</sub> gassed screw-cap tubes
    under N<sub>2</sub> gas.
- step_number: 4
  action: MIX
  description: During the first 24 h, the iron of the medium precipitates in the form
    of black flocks. No other sediment should arise in the otherwise clear medium.
- step_number: 5
  action: AUTOCLAVE
  description: Aliquot Solution A into 100 mL screw-cap bottles, filled with 46 mL
    each. Bubble with N2/CO2 and autoclave at 121°C for 15 min (as decribed below).
- step_number: 6
  action: MIX
  description: Prepare the following solutions (resazurin, bicarbonate and Pfennig's
    heterotrophic salts) and sterilize as given below.
- step_number: 7
  action: COOL
  description: Add bicarbonate solution and Pfennig's heterotrophic salts to the resazurin
    (complete volumina, i.e. 50 mL bicarbonate solution and 26 mL Pfennig's heterotrophic
    salts solution). Bubble with CO2 in an ice bath under sterile conditions.
- step_number: 8
  action: MIX
  description: Fill 50 ml of this mixture to each bottle of solution A (46 mL + 50
    mL).
- step_number: 9
  action: MIX
  description: Before use, add 4 ml sulfide solution (1.5%) and 0.1 ml Vitamin B12
    solution to each 100 mL bottle.
- step_number: 10
  action: MIX
  description: Feed the actively growing culture periodically with neutralized 3%
    solution of sodium sulfide (use 1 -3 mL/100 mL depending on strain and cultivation
    stage) to replenish sulfide and with other supplement solutions (see Ref. 3365).
- step_number: 11
  action: AUTOCLAVE
  description: The sulfide solution is prepared in a 250 ml screw-capped bottle with
    a butyl rubber septum and a magnetic stirrer. The solution is bubbled with nitrogen
    gas, closed and autoclaved for 15 min. at 121°C. After cooling to room temperature
    the pH is adjusted to about 7.0 by adding of sterile 2 M H2SO4 drop-wise with
    a syringe without opening the bottle.
