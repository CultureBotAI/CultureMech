  action: DISSOLVE
  description: 'Note: 20 g calcium carbonate in the medium serves as a buffer. The
    calcium carbonate will settle in agar plates before the agar has set, producing
    an opaque layer in the bottom. As the strain grows and acid is produced this will
    react with the calcium carbonate, causing it to dissolve and form zones of clearing
    immediately below the colonies. In liquid culture the calcium carbonate also forms
    a sediment that clears as acid is produced.'
