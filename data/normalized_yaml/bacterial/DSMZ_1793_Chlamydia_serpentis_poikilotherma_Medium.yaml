preparation_steps:
- step_number: 1
  action: FILTER_STERILIZE
  description: Filter-sterilize (0.2 µm) and keep no longer than 4 weeks. Store at
    room temperature to facilitate detection of contamination.
- step_number: 2
  action: HEAT
  description: Prepare a 25 cm2 flask and seed cells according to standard protocols.
    Incubate at 37°C plus 5% CO2. When a confluent layer has formed, infection can
    be carried out.
- step_number: 3
  action: HEAT
  description: Exchange medium with Infection Medium (as above with the addition of
    cycloheximide) and add 500 - 1000 µl of EB stock solution (thawed quickly to 37°C).
- step_number: 4
  action: HEAT
  description: Centrifuge for 1 h onto the cell layer at 1000 x g at >20°C.
- step_number: 5
  action: HEAT
  description: Incubate at 37°C + 5% CO2. Control cells daily and look for inclusions.
    Not all Chlamydiae form well-visible inclusions, ultimately, immunofluorescence
    or in situ-hybridization techniques are necessary to visualize inclusions.
- step_number: 6
  action: MIX
  description: Filtrate.
- step_number: 7
  action: MIX
  description: Filtrate.
