- step_number: 1
  action: AUTOCLAVE
  description: Dissolve dehydrated RCM medium (available from BD BBL, OXOID, or MERCK)
    in distilled water and add 0.5 ml/l Na-resazurin solution (0.1% w/v). Bring to
    a boil and cool to room temperature while sparging with an 80% N2 and 20% CO2
    gas mixture. Dispense medium under same gas atmosphere into anoxic Hungate-type
    tubes or serum vials and autoclave for 15 min at 121°C. Before use, add 1.0 g
    of sodium carbonate per liter medium from a sterile anoxic stock solution prepared
    under an 80% N2 and 20% CO2 gas mixture. Check the pH of the medium after autoclaving
    and adjust the pH to 6.8 if necessary.
