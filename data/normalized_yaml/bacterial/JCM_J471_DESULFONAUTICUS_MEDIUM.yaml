  description: Use Medium No. 383, replacing sodium lactate with 0.7 g/L sodium acetate
    and 2.0 g/L yeast extract. Prepare the medium under a H2-CO2 (4:1, v/v) gas atmosphere
    and reduce the medium with final 0.1 g/L Na2S x 9H2O and 0.03 g/L sodium dithionite
    (filter-sterilized, prepare the solution just before use). Pressurize the inoculated
    culture vessels to 100 kPa H2-CO2 (4:1, v/v).
