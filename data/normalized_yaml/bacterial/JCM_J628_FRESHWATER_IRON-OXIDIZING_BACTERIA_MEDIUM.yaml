preparation_steps:
- step_number: 1
  action: MIX
  description: The culture medium consists of two layers to create opposing gradients
    of O2 and Fe(II). The top layer is the semisolid mineral salts medium and the
    bottom layer serves as the iron source.
- step_number: 2
  action: ADJUST_PH
  description: Adjust pH to 6.2.
- step_number: 3
  action: AUTOCLAVE
  description: Autoclave both layer solutions. Shortly after autoclaving, pipette
    the bottom layer into each culture vessel (typically 0.75 ml in 10 ml glass vials,
    use pipette tips that have been cut to enlarge the opening). The bottom layer
    is allowed to cool for at least 30 min to ensure its solidification. Cool the
    top layer to 35 - 40C, add 1 ml Trace vitamins (see Medium No. 197) and adjust
    pH to 6.1 - 6.4 by bubbling with sterile CO2 gas. Slowly overlay the top layer
    onto the solidified bottom layer (3.75 ml in the 10 ml vial). Allow to solidify
    the top layer a minimum of 3 hr to a maximum of overnight. To inoculate, 10 ï¿½l
    of the inoculum is drown into a pipette tip and inject just above the bottom layer.
    Seal vials with butyl rubber stoppers and replace the gas phase with a N2-CO2-O2
    (8:1:1, v/v) gas mixture.
- step_number: 4
  action: ADJUST_PH
  description: Prewarm distilled water at 50C in a beaker with a stir bar. While rapidly
    starring the water, add FeSO4 x 7H2O, followed immediately by Na2S x 9H2O. A thick
    black precipitate will form instantly. Stir continuously for 2 to 3 min. Remove
    the mixture to a narrow-mouthed glass bottle (500 ml) that can be tightly stopped.
    The bottle is filled to the top with distilled water and capped. Allow to settle
    for several hours, decant and replace the overlaying water. Repeat this procedure
    at least five times to wash the FeS precipitate. Check pH to be close to neutral.
    To stock the FeS solution, fill the bottle with distilled water and cap. Remove
    the overlaying water when prepare the bottom layer.
