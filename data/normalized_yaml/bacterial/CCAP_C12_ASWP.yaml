preparation_steps:
- step_number: 1
  action: AUTOCLAVE
  description: "Make up to 1 litre with deionized water and adjust pH to 7.6 - 7.8\
    \ with 1M NaOH or 1M HCl.\r\nAutoclave at 15 psi for 15 minutes."
- step_number: 2
  action: MIX
  description: "Site selection for a good soil is very important and for most purposes\
    \ a soil from undisturbed\r\ndeciduous woodland is best. Sites to avoid are those\
    \ showing obvious signs of man's activity\r\nand particular care should be taken\
    \ to avoid areas where fertilizers, crop sprays or other toxic\r\nchemicals may\
    \ have been used."
- step_number: 3
  action: HEAT
  description: "A rich loam with good crumb structure should be sought. Stones, roots\
    \ and larger\r\ninvertebrates should be removed during an initial sieving through\
    \ a 1 cm mesh. The sieved\r\nsoil should be spread to air dry and handpicked for\
    \ smaller invertebrates and roots. It should\r\nbe turned periodically and picked\
    \ over again. When dry sieve through a finer mesh (2-4 mm)\r\nand store in an\
    \ airtight container away from light and heat."
- step_number: 4
  action: AUTOCLAVE
  description: "Soil is prepared as above. Air-dried soil and twice its volume of\
    \ supernatant distilled water\r\nare autoclaved together at 15 psi for 2 hours\
    \ and left to cool. The supernatant is then\r\ndecanted and then distributed to\
    \ containers in volumes suitable for making up batches of\r\nmedia. The aliquots\
    \ and their containers are autoclaved for an appropriate length of time\r\n(e.g.\
    \ 1 litre or less for 15 minutes) and are then kept in a cool place (e.g. a refrigerator)\
    \ until\r\nrequired."
