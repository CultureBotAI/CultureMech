  description: Media for maintenance of infected amoeba cultures
- step_number: 2
  action: MIX
  description: OR
- step_number: 3
  action: AUTOCLAVE
  description: Adjust pH to 7.3, autoclave at 121°C
- step_number: 4
  action: AUTOCLAVE
  description: Adjust pH to 6.5, autoclave at 110°C or filter-sterilize
- step_number: 5
  action: HEAT
  description: Infected amoeba cultures can be maintained e.g. in 25 cm2 flasks (e.g.
    Nunc flasks, VWR, 734-2081, Thermo-Scientific, 156340) at 20-30°C in an incubator
    (no special requirements concerning CO2 or light).
- step_number: 6
  action: MIX
  description: Infected Acanthamoeba cultures don't have to be transferred to fresh
    culture flasks as frequently as usually done for mammalian cell cultures. Amoeba
    cultures can be maintained in the same flask for several weeks or months. However,
    if the cultures reach a high cell density, medium should be exchanged. For that
    purpose amoebae are detached from the surface of the flask by knocking at the
    culture flask (no trypsin required, amoebae are only weakly adherent compared
    to most mammalian cells) and the medium (containing the majority of cells) is
    then completely removed. Fresh medium is added and the few remaining attached
    amoebae will continue to grow.
- step_number: 7
  action: ALIQUOT
  description: Alternatively, cultures can also be passaged regularly (e.g. weekly)
    by transfer of a small aliquot of a densely grown culture (after cell detachment,
    as described above) to a fresh flask containing medium.
- step_number: 8
  action: MIX
  description: If cultures contain few attached cells, but high amounts of cell debris,
    medium should be exchanged without prior cell detachment. Cultures usually recover
    fast.
- step_number: 9
  action: MIX
  description: Depending on the host cell strain, the bacteria may cause host cell
    lysis. To maintain such cultures, bacteria have to be transferred by adding culture
    supernatant (approximately 0.5 ml) to fresh culture flasks containing uninfected
    host cells (approximately semi-confluent culture) each 7-10 days.

  action: HEAT
  description: at -80°C for several months.
- step_number: 12
  action: STORE
  description: Infected cell cultures (supplemented with 10% DMSO) are best stored
    in liquid nitrogen.
