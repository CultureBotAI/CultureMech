  description: Use Medium No. 92 with 44.2 g/L (final) FeSO4 x 7H2O, 5 ml 10 N H2SO4
    and 0.5 g/L yeast extract. Dissolve ingredients except FeSO4 x 7H2O, yeast extract
    and 10 N H2SO4 in 700 ml distilled water and autoclave. Separately dissolve FeSO4
    x 7H2O in 300 ml distilled water with 10 N H2SO4 and autoclave at 110C for 30
    min. After cooling, mix the both solutions. Before inoculation, add yeast extract
    from a sterile stock solution (10%). Check the final pH to be 1.5 - 2.0.
