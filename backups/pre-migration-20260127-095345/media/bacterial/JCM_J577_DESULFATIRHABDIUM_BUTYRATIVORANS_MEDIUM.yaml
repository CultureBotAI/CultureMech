  description: Use Medium No. 284 supplemented with 2.8 g Na2SO4and 0.2 g (final)
    yeast extract in Solution A (per 900 ml), and with 1.72 g crotonic acid and 0.43
    g sodium benzoate in Solution B (per 100 ml) instead of sodium pyruvate. Prior
    to inoculation, aseptically and anaerobically add 0.01 volume of 5% Na2S x 9H2O
    solution (autoclaved and stored under a N2 atmosphere) to the medium. Pressurize
    the inoculated bottles to 170 kPa with N2-CO2 (80:20, v/v).
