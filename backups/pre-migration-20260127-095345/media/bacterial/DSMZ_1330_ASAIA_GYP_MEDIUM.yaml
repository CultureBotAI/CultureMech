preparation_steps:
- step_number: 1
  action: DISSOLVE
  description: The medium may be solidified by adding 15 g/l agar. Calcium carbonate
    in the medium serves as a buffer. The calcium carbonate will settle in agar plates
    before the agar has set, producing an opaque layer in the bottom. As the strain
    grows and acid is produced this will react with the calcium carbonate, causing
    it to dissolve and form zones of clearing immediately below the colonies. pH 6.8
