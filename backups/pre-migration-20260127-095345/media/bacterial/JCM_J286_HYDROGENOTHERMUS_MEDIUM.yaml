  description: Use Aquifex medium (Medium No. 255) without Trace vitamins and supplement
    with 0.2 g/L yeast extract (BD-Difco) and 0.5 g/L sulfur (powder). Mix ingredients
    except sulfur and adjust pH to 7.0 with H2SO4. Autoclave the medium under a gas
    mixture of H2-CO2 (4:1, v/v), and stand overnight. Steam sulfur for 3 hr on each
    of 3 successive days. Aseptically dispense 20 ml of the medium into serum bottles
    (120 ml) containing the sterilized sulfur (0.01 g/bottle) under a stream of H2-CO2
    (4:1, v/v) gas mixture and seal with butyl rubber stoppers. After inoculation,
    add 15.0 ml filter-sterilized air, and pressurize to 200 kPa with a H2-CO2 (4:1,
    v/v) gas mixture.
