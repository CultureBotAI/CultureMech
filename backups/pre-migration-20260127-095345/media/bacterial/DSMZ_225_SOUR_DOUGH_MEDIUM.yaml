  action: ADJUST_PH
  description: Adjust pH to 5.6 with 20% lactic acid or HCl. Fresh yeast extract is
    prepared by autoclaving a 20% suspension of commercial baker's yeast in distilled
    water for 30 minutes at 121°C, allowing the suspension to settle overnight at
    2 to 8°C, decanting and further clarifying the supernatant by centrifugation.
    The extract prepared in this manner contains 1.5% solids and if not to be used
    within a few days, should be frozen or freeze-dried immediately.
