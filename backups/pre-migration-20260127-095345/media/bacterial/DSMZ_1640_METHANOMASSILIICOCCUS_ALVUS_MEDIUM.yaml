  action: AUTOCLAVE
  description: Suspend Anaerobe Basal Broth in distilled water. Adjust pH to 7.4 with
    1N NaOH and bring to the boil to dissolve ingredients completely. Then cool medium
    to room temperature while sparging with 100% N2 gas to make it anoxic. Distribute
    medium under 100% N2 gas atmosphere into anoxic Hungate-type tubes or serum vials
    to 30% of their volume and autoclave. After sterilization add methanol from an
    anoxic stock solution autoclaved under 100% N2 gas atmosphere. Adjust pH of complete
    medium to 7.4 - 7.6, if necessary.
- step_number: 2
  action: MIX
  description: After inoculation, add sterile 80% H2 and 20% CO2 gas mixture to 0.5
    bar overpressure.
