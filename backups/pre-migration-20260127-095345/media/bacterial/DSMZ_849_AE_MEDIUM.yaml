  action: AUTOCLAVE
  description: Both liquid and solid media are prepared by autoclaving the medium
    without the addition of glacial acetic acid and absolute ethanol. Glacial acetic
    acid and absolute ethanol are sterilised either by filtration (use Teflon filters)
    or they may be autoclaved in completely closed screw cap glass bottles sealed
    with a Teflon coated septum. A double layer system das not appear to be essential
    for the growth of this organism, however, plates should be incubated in sealed
    containers to keep the humidity high (> 90%).
