## Ownership

Candidate authoritative input paths (ID/name linkage; not proof of source equivalence):
- data/normalized_yaml/bacterial/TOGO_M2582_Columbia_Blood_Medium.yaml

## Concentration Claims

Missing means absent from inspected YAML, not absent from the scientific literature. Plausibility flags are triage leads, not proven errors.

| Field / ingredient | Existing amount | Evidence state / flags | Decision / source check | Proposed amount | Evidence and calculation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ingredients[0].concentration / Defibrinated sheep blood | {"value": "5", "unit": "PERCENT_W_V"} | missing_attached_evidence;  | unsupported; not_performed | unknown | No scoped concentration evidence attached; source lookup pending |
| ingredients[1].concentration / Columbia agar base | {"value": "1", "unit": "G_PER_L"} | missing_attached_evidence;  | unsupported; not_performed | unknown | No scoped concentration evidence attached; source lookup pending |

## Follow-up

Inspect the exact source formulation, quote amount/unit/basis, document any calculation, and resolve flags before proposing edits. Stock quantities must remain distinct from final-medium amounts. No findings were applied.
