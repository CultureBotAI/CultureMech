## Ownership

Candidate authoritative input paths (ID/name linkage; not proof of source equivalence):
- data/normalized_yaml/bacterial/nsw.yaml

## Concentration Claims

Missing means absent from inspected YAML, not absent from the scientific literature. Plausibility flags are triage leads, not proven errors.

| Field / ingredient | Existing amount | Evidence state / flags | Decision / source check | Proposed amount | Evidence and calculation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ingredients[0].concentration / Natural sea water | {"value": "1000", "unit": "G_PER_L"} | missing_attached_evidence; PLAUSIBILITY_WATER_AS_VOLUME | unsupported; not_performed | unknown | No scoped concentration evidence attached; source lookup pending |

## Source Leads

These references have not been fetched unless explicitly source-checked above.

## Follow-up

Inspect the exact source formulation, quote amount/unit/basis, document any calculation, and resolve flags before proposing edits. Stock quantities must remain distinct from final-medium amounts. No findings were applied.
