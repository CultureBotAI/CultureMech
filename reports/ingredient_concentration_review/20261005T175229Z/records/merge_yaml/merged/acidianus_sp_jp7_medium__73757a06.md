## Concentration Claims

Missing means absent from inspected YAML, not absent from the scientific literature. Plausibility flags are triage leads, not proven errors.

## Follow-up

Inspect the exact source formulation, quote amount/unit/basis, document any calculation, and resolve flags before proposing edits. Stock quantities must remain distinct from final-medium amounts. No findings were applied.
