## Ownership

Candidate authoritative input paths (ID/name linkage; not proof of source equivalence):
- data/normalized_yaml/specialized/m63_quarter_strength_nocarbon.yaml

## Concentration Claims

Missing means absent from inspected YAML, not absent from the scientific literature. Plausibility flags are triage leads, not proven errors.

## Follow-up

Inspect the exact source formulation, quote amount/unit/basis, document any calculation, and resolve flags before proposing edits. Stock quantities must remain distinct from final-medium amounts. No findings were applied.
