- Source type: official DSMZ dataset; discovery: verified KOMODO cross-reference; authors/year not supplied.
- State: changed locally; unresolved claims remain unchanged.
- Baseline schema errors: 0; proposed schema errors: 0.
- Operational failure: none

Exact mapping identities and source-access status were checked. Amount quotations and arithmetic were checked for accepted claims only; unresolved records were not endorsed. This is not a claim of manual inspection of every source sentence or automated reference-validator success. Preparation-dependent quantities and unrepresented stocks remain open. Schema validity is not scientific proof.

This is identity evidence only. A variant's link to a base recipe does not support the variant's quantities. The complete claim table above includes unchanged and unresolved results; a report is not scientific completion.
