Source response, exact IDs/labels, arithmetic, and literal snippets were checked by the maintained guarded reviewer. This is not a claim of manual inspection of every source sentence or automated reference-validator success. Preparation-dependent quantities and unrepresented stocks remain open. Schema validity is not scientific proof.

Arithmetic check: 1.5 g * 1 g/g / (30 ml / 1000 ml per L) = 5E+1 g/L, consistent with the reported value at its precision. Evidence supports the provider-declared concentration within this solution, not a concentration in a receiving medium or an independently measured final volume.

## Medium212 Source-Specific Follow-Up

The source-specific ingredient review is complete for this checkpoint: the guarded repair is applied locally. The [current follow-up](../../../20261009-synthrophomonas-family/applied-records/S454.md) contains every old/new claim, exact supporting snippet, source uncertainty and actual validation result. This earlier report remains historical context.
