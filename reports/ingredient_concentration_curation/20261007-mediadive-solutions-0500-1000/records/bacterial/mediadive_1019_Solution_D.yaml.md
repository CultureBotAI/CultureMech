Source response, exact IDs/labels, arithmetic, and literal snippets were checked by the maintained guarded reviewer. This is not a claim of manual inspection of every source sentence or automated reference-validator success. Preparation-dependent quantities and unrepresented stocks remain open. Schema validity is not scientific proof.

Arithmetic check: 0.4 g * 1 g/g / (10 ml / 1000 ml per L) = 4E+1 g/L, consistent with the reported value at its precision. Evidence supports the provider-declared concentration within this solution, not a concentration in a receiving medium or an independently measured final volume. Water addition alone is not used to infer a final volume. Additional exact excerpt at $.data.volume: "volume": 10. | applied |

No source preparation step gives a competing make-up instruction. This is a batch dose, not a volume percentage; no final-volume or solvent-density assumption is made.
