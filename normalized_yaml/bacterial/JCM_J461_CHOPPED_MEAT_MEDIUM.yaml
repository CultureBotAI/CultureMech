preparation_steps:
- step_number: 1
  action: FILTER_STERILIZE
  description: 'Use lean beef or horse meat. Remove fat and connective tissue before
    grinding. Mix meat, water and NaOH, then boil for 15 min with stirring. Cool to
    room temperature, skim fat off surface and filter, retaining both meat particles
    and filtrate. Add water to the filtrate to a final volume of 1.0 L and then add
    the following:'
- step_number: 2
  action: AUTOCLAVE
  description: Boil, cool, add 0.5 g L-cysteine x HCl x H2O and adjust pH to 7.0.
    Dispense 7 ml into tubes containing meat particles (use 1 part meat particles
    to 4 or 5 parts fluid) under a N2 atmosphere and seal with butyl rubber stoppers.
    Autoclave at 121C for 30 min. For agar slants, use 15 g agar per 1.0 L medium.
    Alternatively, commercially available Cooked Meat Medium may be used (Oxoid CM81;
    Merck 10928; Difco 0267-01-7). The medium should be supplemented with 5 g/L yeast
    extract, 5 g/L K2HPO4, 1 mg/L resazurin, and 0.5 g/L L-cysteine x HCl x H2O.
