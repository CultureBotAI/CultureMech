preparation_steps:
- step_number: 1
  action: MIX
  description: 8:2 mixture or 1:1 mixture
- step_number: 2
  action: AUTOCLAVE
  description: See separate recipes.  Mix then autoclave at 15 psi for 15 minutes.
- step_number: 3
  action: MIX
  description: Make up to 1 litre with glass distilled or deionised water.
- step_number: 4
  action: AUTOCLAVE
  description: "Mix  the  above  constituents  and  autoclave  at  15 psi for  15\
    \  minutes.  It may  be \r\nnecessary to filter final medium to avoid problems\
    \ with precipitate."
- step_number: 5
  action: AUTOCLAVE
  description: Make up to 1 litre with deionized water and autoclave at 15 psi for
    15 minutes.

  action: MIX
  description: "At the  CCAP, SE1 is  used for  marine algae, SE2 for freshwater \
    \ and terrestrial\r\nprotozoa"
- step_number: 7
  action: MIX
  description: "Site selection for a good soil is very important and for most purposes\
    \ a soil from undisturbed\r\ndeciduous woodland is best. Sites to avoid are those\
    \ showing obvious signs of man's activity\r\nand particular care should be taken\
    \ to avoid areas where fertilizers, crop sprays or other toxic\r\nchemicals may\
    \ have been used."
- step_number: 8
  action: HEAT
  description: "A rich loam with good crumb structure should be sought. Stones, roots\
    \ and larger\r\ninvertebrates should be removed during an initial sieving through\
    \ a 1 cm mesh. The sieved\r\nsoil should be spread to air dry and handpicked for\
    \ smaller invertebrates and roots. It should\r\nbe turned periodically and picked\
    \ over again. When dry sieve through a finer mesh (2-4 mm)\r\nand store in an\
    \ airtight container away from light and heat."
- step_number: 9
  action: AUTOCLAVE
  description: "Soil is  prepared  as  above.  Air­-dried  soil and  twice  its  volume\
    \  of  supernatant\r\ndistilled water are autoclaved together at 15 psi for 2\
    \ hours and left to cool.  The \r\nsupernatant is then decanted and filtered through\
    \ Whatman No 1 filter paper, then\r\ndistributed to containers in volumes suitable\
    \ for making up batches of media. The \r\naliquots and their containers are autoclaved\
    \ for an appropriate length of time (e.g.\r\n1 litre or less for 15 minutes) and\
    \ are then kept in a cool place (e.g. a refrigerator) \r\nuntil required."

- step_number: 12
  action: AUTOCLAVE
  description: "Soil is prepared as above.  105 g of air­dried sieved soil and 660\
    \ ml of deionized \r\nwater are placed in a 1 litre bottle and autoclaved once\
    \ at 15 psi for 15 minutes, \r\nthen again after 24 hours.  The contents of the\
    \ bottle are left to settle (usually for \r\nat least a week) and then the supernatant\
    \ is decanted and filtered.  The final pH\r\nshould be 7.0 - 8.0."
