  action: ALIQUOT
  description: "Infected Acanthamoeba cultures don’t have to be transferred to fresh\
    \ culture flasks as\r\nfrequently as usually done for mammalian cell cultures.\
    \ Amoeba cultures can be\r\nmaintained in the same flask for several weeks or\
    \ months. However, if the cultures reach\r\na high cell density, medium should\
    \ be exchanged. For that purpose amoebae are\r\ndetached from the surface of the\
    \ flask by knocking at the culture flask (no trypsin\r\nrequired, amoebae are\
    \ only weakly adherent compared to most mammalian cells) and\r\nthe medium (containing\
    \ the majority of cells) is then completely removed. Fresh medium\r\nis added\
    \ and the few remaining attached amoebae will continue to grow.\r\nAlternatively,\
    \ cultures can also be passaged regularly (e.g. weekly) by transfer of a small\r\
    \naliquot of a densely grown culture (after cell detachment, as described above)\
    \ to a fresh\r\nflask containing medium. If cultures contain few attached cells,\
    \ but high amounts of cell debris, medium should be\r\nexchanged without prior\
    \ cell detachment. Cultures usually recover fast.\r\nDepending on the host cell\
    \ strain, the bacteria may cause host cell lysis. To maintain\r\nsuch cultures,\
    \ bacteria have to be transferred by adding culture supernatant\r\n(approximately\
    \ 0.5 ml) to fresh culture flasks containing uninfected host cells\r\n(approximately\
    \ semi-confluent culture) each 7-10 days."
